## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management

### üö® **High-Risk Areas**

#### **API Integration Challenges**
- **Risk**: TMDB API rate limiting or service downtime
- **Mitigation**: Implement robust error handling, retry logic, and caching
- **Contingency**: Mock data fallback for development and testing

#### **Performance Issues**
- **Risk**: Large bundle size or slow loading times
- **Mitigation**: Regular bundle analysis, code splitting, image optimization
- **Contingency**: Progressive enhancement and lazy loading strategies

#### **Cross-browser Compatibility**
- **Risk**: Features not working consistently across browsers
- **Mitigation**: Regular testing on target browsers, polyfill usage
- **Contingency**: Graceful degradation for unsupported features

### ‚ö° **Medium-Risk Areas**

#### **TypeScript Complexity**
- **Risk**: Complex typing slowing down development
- **Mitigation**: Start with basic types, gradually add complexity
- **Contingency**: Use `any` type judiciously for rapid prototyping

#### **State Management Complexity**
- **Risk**: Over-engineering state management solution
- **Mitigation**: Start simple with Zustand, add complexity as needed
- **Contingency**: Fallback to React Context for simpler state needs

#### **Testing Coverage**
- **Risk**: Insufficient test coverage delaying deployment
- **Mitigation**: Write tests alongside development, not after
- **Contingency**: Focus on critical path testing first

### üìã **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Regular Check-ins**: Weekly progress reviews and adjustments
2. **Incremental Development**: Small, testable increments
3. **Early Testing**: Test early and often to catch issues
4. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date for handoffs
5. **Backup Plans**: Always have a simpler fallback option ready

# CORS Fix Implementation

## Problem

The application was experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when deployed to Netlify. The frontend was trying to make direct API calls to `https://api.themoviedb.org/3` from `https://cineflex-movies.netlify.app`, which was blocked by the browser's same-origin policy.

## Solution

Implemented a Netlify Function proxy to handle TMDB API requests server-side, avoiding CORS issues entirely.

## Implementation

### 1. Netlify Function (`netlify/functions/tmdb-proxy.js`)

- Acts as a proxy between the frontend and TMDB API
- Handles CORS headers automatically
- Forwards requests to TMDB API with proper authentication
- Returns responses with appropriate headers

### 2. HTTP Client Configuration (`src/shared/services/httpClient.ts`)

```typescript
const baseURL = import.meta.env.DEV
  ? '/api/tmdb' // Development: Vite proxy
  : '/.netlify/functions/tmdb-proxy'; // Production: Direct function call
```

### 3. Netlify Configuration (`netlify.toml`)

- Redirects `/api/tmdb/*` to the Netlify function
- Handles client-side routing
- Sets security headers and caching policies

## Benefits

- ✅ **No CORS errors**: All requests stay on the same domain
- ✅ **Secure**: API token is kept server-side
- ✅ **Reliable**: Direct function calls work consistently
- ✅ **Fast**: Serverless functions provide good performance
- ✅ **Scalable**: Netlify handles function scaling automatically

## Testing

The solution has been tested and confirmed working:

- Direct function calls return complete TMDB data
- All API endpoints work correctly
- No CORS errors in production

## Files Modified

- `netlify/functions/tmdb-proxy.js` - Main proxy function
- `src/shared/services/httpClient.ts` - Updated base URL logic
- `netlify.toml` - Redirect configuration
- `netlify/functions/package.json` - Function dependencies
